## Usage

1. Replace the version number in the description
2. Update the changes sections based on your PR
3. Update the commit hashes and messages
4. Replace the PR number (226) with your PR number
5. Add, remove, or rename section headers (like "CI Improvements", "Access Control Fixes", etc.) to match the actual changes in your PR. The template sections are just examples.
6. Run the command

## Template

<!--
  The following sections ("Version Update", "CI Improvements", "Access Control Fixes", etc.) are just examples.
  For your pull request, add, remove, or rename sections to reflect the actual changes (e.g., "UI Updates", "API Changes", "Bug Fixes", etc.).
-->

```markdown

- Make sure you have the GitHub CLI installed and are authenticated
- The command creates a temporary file and removes it after use
- The formatting follows GitHub's Markdown specifications
- Sections can be added or removed based on the PR content
- Always clean up the temporary `pr_description.md` file after creating the PR
