# GitHub CLI Rules

## User
- if no user is specified, use "@me" as assignee if you think a user is required

## Default Settings
- Organization: hypeIT-GmbH

## Rules

### Projects
- assume that the spelling when it comes to upper- or lowercase is not correct
- try to find a project similar, if you cannot find an exact match

### GitHub Issues
When handling GitHub issues:
- Use username: FritzMatthaeus
- Look for repositories in hypeIT-GmbH organization first
- If repository not found in hypeIT-GmbH, ask user for correct organization
- Default assignee: FritzMatthaeus
- When listing issues across all repositories:
  - Use `gh search issues` instead of `gh issue list` for cross-repository searches
  - Always include both open and closed issues unless specifically requested otherwise
  - Use `--author "@me"` to find all issues created by the current user
  - Use `--assignee "@me"` to find all issues assigned to the current user
  - Combine both flags to get a complete list of issues
  - Available JSON fields for issue listing:
    - number
    - title
    - state
    - url
    - assignees
    - author
    - body
    - closed
    - closedAt
    - comments
    - createdAt
    - id
    - isPinned
    - labels
    - milestone
    - projectCards
    - projectItems
    - reactionGroups
    - stateReason
    - updatedAt
  - Do not use the "repository" field as it's not available in the JSON output
  - For repository-specific searches, use `gh issue list` with the `-R` flag
  - When searching for issues, always use the `--json` flag with appropriate fields to get structured output

## Examples
```bash
# List all issues (open and closed) created by FritzMatthaeus across all repositories
gh search issues --author "@me" --json number,title,state,url

# List all issues (open and closed) assigned to FritzMatthaeus across all repositories
gh search issues --assignee "@me" --json number,title,state,url

# List all issues (open and closed) both created by and assigned to FritzMatthaeus
gh search issues --author "@me" --assignee "@me" --json number,title,state,url

# List open issues assigned to FritzMatthaeus in a specific repository
gh issue list -R hypeIT-GmbH/Producely-Go --assignee "@me" --state open

# List open PRs by Markus Rabsch
gh pr list -R hypeIT-GmbH/Producely-Go --author Markus-hypeIT --state open
```
