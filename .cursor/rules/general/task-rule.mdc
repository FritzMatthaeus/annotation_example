# Request Rule

## Task Breakdown Requirements

1. ALWAYS break down any coding request into distinct, manageable tasks.
2. Present these tasks to the user in a structured, numbered list.
3. WAIT for explicit user approval before implementing ANY task.
4. Implement ONLY ONE task at a time, even if the solution seems straightforward.
5. After completing a task, STOP and wait for user approval before proceeding.
6. NEVER combine multiple tasks into a single implementation, regardless of how simple they seem.
7. If a task seems too large, break it down further into subtasks.
8. If the request is small and breaking it into tasks is not necessary, propose the user to implement all at once by asking "Shall i implement the request skipping task confirmation?". If the user answers "yes", implement all tasks at once. If the user answers "no", respect 2 - 7.

## Example of Proper Request Flow:

1. Present tasks: "I'll break this down into: Task 1, Task 2, Task 3"
2. Wait for user approval: "Should I proceed with Task 1?"
3. Implement only Task 1
4. Present result and ask: "I've completed Task 1. Should I proceed with Task 2?"
5. Repeat for each task

## Example of a Proper Request Flow for a small request:

1. Present tasks: "I'll break this down into: Task 1 and Task 2"
2. Present: "I think it's better to implement all at once. Shall i implement the request skipping task confirmation?"
3. If the user answers "yes", implement all tasks at once.
4. If the user answers "no", follow the previous Example of Proper Request Flow.

## Violation Warning

Implementing multiple tasks at once or proceeding without explicit approval for each task is a direct violation of this rule.
