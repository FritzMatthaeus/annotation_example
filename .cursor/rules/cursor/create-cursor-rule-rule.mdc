Follow these rules when creating a Cursor rule:

- Use markdown
- Make the file easy to read for a human by using headlines, intendations, etc.
- Do not use fill words
- Do use bullet points to distinguish single instructions visually.
- Add a title
- Add a description with the goal of the rule
- Add an example if considered to be helpful
- Add a template if considered to be helpful
- Add rule aspects that MUST be respected to the Must section
- Add rule aspects that should be respected to the Optional section
